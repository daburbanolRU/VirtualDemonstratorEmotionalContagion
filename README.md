# VirtualDemonstratorEmotionalContagion
Experimental Data for the manuscript: Exploring emotional contagion in zebrafish: a virtual-demonstrator study of positive and
negative emotions

The dataset consist of five files.
- The first file, RawData.xlxs, contains the fish swimming trajectories X and Y of all fish in the experiment. Each sheet corresponds to an experimental condition, namely, Control, High Geotaxis, and Low Geotaxis. In these files, rows are samples at different times (18,000 samples = 10 min at 30 frames/s)
- The four remaining files contain data on behavioral scoring across time. Each one of these files contains four columns corresponding to the variable (Time spent at the bottom, speed, acceleration, absolute turn rate), Time bin (2,4,6,8, or 10 min), and the subject ID.
